The technologies used in this project were ReactJS, Typescript, and Vite. For styling, interface, and responsiveness, the Tailwind framework was used, which helps simplify the styling process.

It also has the following dependencies:

Radix UI, a library that assists in creating React components, offering a flexible and accessible approach to interface creation.

date-fns, this library aids in manipulating dates in an easy and efficient manner.

Lucide React, an open-source icon library with over 1000 SVG file options. This library makes it easy to incorporate icons into projects.

Sonner, with this library, it is possible to implement toast-type alerts in the application quickly and efficiently.
## About

#### Note-taking application

The focus of this application is to create notes in a way that they are ordered by the creation date. These notes can be created through speech recognition (depending on the browser's availability) or through writing.

If you choose to use voice recognition, when starting the recording, it is possible to visualize on the screen what is being said.

Finally, if you have finished speaking, simply click on the button below to stop the recording and then click on the "Save note" button.

At the top, there is a field to search and filter the existing notes.
